# movie_ratings_server

This is web scraper script I wrote for my own use. It scrapes channels' streaming info, adds imdb ratings to the movies and stores them as structured data. Currenty only "Sinema TV" network's channels are supported. 

I'm intended to build a client app that would use json files produced by this script as a data source.
